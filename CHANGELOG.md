### Added

- Typing for typescript \[[MerlinPerrotLegler]]

[v3.6.0 milestone](https://github.com/opening-hours/opening_hours.js/issues?q=milestone%3Av3.6.0+is%3Aclosed)

### Added

- Public holiday definitions added:
  - Australia \[[yourock17], [ypid]]
  - England and Wales \[[skifans], [simon04]]
  - Finland \[[Virtakuono]]
  - Greece \[[hariskar]]
  - Ireland \[[Gerw88], [ypid]]
  - Ivory Coast \[[sommerluk], [ypid]]
  - New Zealand \[[Mortein]]
  - Norway \[[Gazer75]]
  - Spain \[[jmontane]]
  - Switzerland \[[mstock], [emilsivro], [simonpoole], [ypid]]
  - Vietnam \[[goodudetheboy]]
- School holiday definitions added:
  - Austria \[[simon04]]
  - Belgium \[[pietervdvn]]
  - France \[[blef00fr], [ypid]]
  - Germany 2017 until 2024 \[[ypid], [KristjanESPERANTO]]
  - Greece \[[hariskar], [ypid]]
- Added Easter Sunday to Slovak holidays. \[[chiak597]]
- Localizations added:
  - Hungarian \[[urbalazs], [debyos]]
  - Spanish \[[Robot8A], [ypid]]
- Translate error tolerance warnings into German. \[[ypid]]
- Add +/-1 week button to evaluation tool. \[[stefanct]]
- Add additional warnings:
  - Misused `.` character. Example: `Jan 01,Dec 24.-25.`. \[[ypid]]
  - Trailing `,` after time selector. Example: `We 12:00-18:00,`. \[[ypid]]
  - Additional rule which evaluates to closed. Example: `Mo-Fr 10:00-20:00, We off`. \[[ypid]]
  - Value consists of multiple rules each only using a time selector. Example: `11:30-14:30;17:30-23:00`. \[[ypid]]
  - Potentially missing use of `<additional_rule_separator>` if the previous rule has a time range which wraps over midnight and the current rule matches one of the following days of the previous rule. One that the warning is not emitted in case wide range selectors are used in both involved rules to avoid a false positive warning where the two rules would never match days directly following each other. Nevertheless this check has false positives and which can be ignored in cases mentioned in the warning. Example: `Fr 22:00-04:00; Sa 21:00-04:00` \[[ypid]]

  - Handle super/subscript digits properly. Example: `Mo 00³°-¹⁴:⁰⁹`. \[[ypid]]

### Changed

- Public holiday definitions updated:
  - Germany \[[StephanGeorg]]
- Migrated to use [ES2015 modules](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_modules.html) and [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for module bundling. \[[simon04]]
- Increased NodeJS version requirement to `10.0.0`. \[[ypid]]
- Update to holiday definition format 2.2.0. Holidays are now maintained in YAML files, one for each country. \[[ypid]]
- Update to holiday definition format 3.0.0. Use nested key-value pairs instead of arrays with a known structure. \[[ypid]]
- Rework the way Nominatim responses are handled (used for testing). \[[ypid]]
- Allow "gaps" in school holiday definitions. This became necessary because countries/states might add/remove holidays like winter holidays from one year to another. \[[ypid]]
- Error tolerance: For a value such as `Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00 by_appointment` the tool did previously suggest to use `Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00 "on appointment"` but as whether to use `by appointment` or `on appointment` is not defined the tool now just uses the already given variant (`Mo-Fr 08:00-12:00 "by appointment"` in this case). \[[ypid]]
- Error tolerance: Interpret the German `werktags?` as `Mo-Sa` instead of `Mo-Fr`. Ref: [§ 3 Bundesurlaubsgesetz (BUrlG)](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/burlg/__3.html). \[[ypid]]
- Make error tolerance warnings translatable. \[[ypid]]
- Improved performance of common constructor calls by factor 6! \[[ypid]]
- Improve number input in the evaluation tool and other HTML and CSS improvements. Useful for example on mobile devices. \[[HolgerJeromin], [ypid]]
- Change from localized dates to ISO 8601 in evaluation tool. The syntax has no support for legacy stuff like AM/PM or weirdly written dates anyway. Commit to ISO 8601 all the way regardless of local quirks. \[[ypid]]
- Merge country into state holidays. This avoids repeating country-wide holidays. \[[simon04]]
- Update simple HTML usage example for using the library in a website. [[KristjanESPERANTO], [ypid]\]
- Replaced moment.js with Date.toLocaleString \[[simon04]]
- Change directory layout of the project. \[[napei], [ypid]]
- Switch from i18next-client to i18next dependency (no longer as peer dependency). \[[fodor0205], [ypid]]

### Fixed

- Fix German public holiday definitions. Since 2018, Reformationstag is also a public holiday in Bremen, Schleswig-Holstein, Niedersachsen and Hamburg. \[[Discostu36], [ypid]]
- Fix Russian public holiday definitions. Regions where not in local language and thus not matched properly. \[[ypid]]
- Fix school holiday selector code which caused the main selector traversal function to not advance any further (returning closed for all following dates) after the school holiday selector code hit a holiday definition ending on the last day of the year. \[[ypid]]
- Fix `check-diff-%.js` Makefile target. `git diff` might not have shown changes or failed to return with an error before. \[[ypid]]
- Fix support for legacy browsers (IE) with using proper for...in loops. \[[shouze]]
- Error tolerance: Fix mapping of Spanish weekdays. \[[maxerickson]]
- Do not zero pad `positive_number` symbols by default in `oh.prettifyValue`. \[[ypid]]

## [v3.5.0](https://github.com/opening-hours/opening_hours.js/compare/v3.4.0...v3.5.0) - 2017-02-17

### Changed

- Use `peerDependencies` to allow dependency reuse by other npm packages. \[[pke], [ypid]]
- Use caret ranges for all npm dependencies. \[[ypid], [pke]]
- Increased NodeJS version requirement to `0.12.3` which fixes one test case. \[[ypid]]

### Fixed

- Public holiday definitions fixed:
  - Germany, Saxony: Add missing "Buß- und Bettag" to the public holiday definition of \[[bugvillage], [ypid]]
  - Fix the `getDateOfWeekdayInDateRange` helper function used to calculate PH of Sweden and Germany Saxony. PH definitions using this functions might have been wrong before. \[[ypid]]
- Fix timezone problem in `PH_SH_exporter.js` (local time was interpreted as UTC). \[[ypid]]
- Fix handling of legacy 12-hour clock format. `12:xxAM` and `12:xxPM` was handled incorrectly! \[[ypid]]
- Fix timezone issue for `PH_SH_exporter.js` unless the `--omit-date-hyphens` option was given. Exported dates which are in DST might be wrong when your system is in a timezone with DST and DST was not active when you run the script. \[[ypid]]
- Fix current week number calculation which was caused by incorrect use of `new Date()` which is a "Reactive" variable. \[[spawn-guy]]
